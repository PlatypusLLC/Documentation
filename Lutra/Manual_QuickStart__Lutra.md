Lutra Quick Start Guide
======

Following this guide will help you get the boat running and into the water as quickly as possible. It is not meant to provide detailed explanations. For that, look through the other sections of the manual.

## brainstorming the outline

start with quick safety briefing
1. typical LiPo safety (link to better source?)
2. keep hands clear of props and fan
3. high voltages, don't fiddle around with wiring - user can access wiring, so they need to be safe

quick screenshots (<= 1 page)
1. the boat
2. the tablet application icon, tablet application buttons chart
3. the phone application icon (phone application buttons chart?)

the quick start guide
1. Charge all batteries beforehand. Best to do it overnight.
2. Cache the maps of your intended area on the tablet control application. To do this, connect the tablet to the internet and turn on the tablet control application and navigate the map to deployment area. The app automatically caches maps as it loads them into view. [link to the page where we describe the tablet app for more details]
3. Gather your equipment: the boat, the tablet, the phone, the battery, any sensors.
4. Travel to your launch point.
5. Turn on the tablet and phone. Launch Google Maps on the phone, to start the process of getting a GPS fix. Also, turn the phone in broad, slow figure eights for 10 seconds to cause the orientation sensors to recalibrate.
6. Launch the Platypus tablet and phone applications.
7. Elevate the boat such that the props are off the ground and can spin without touching anything.
8. Plug in any sensors to the appropriate 8-pin connectors on the top of the eboard.
9. Plug the battery into the boat and hit the white button on the eboard. The LED should blink red. If the LED doesn't light up, press the white button twice quickly to cycle the eboard power. The LED should then blink red.
10. Turning the power on to the eboard will cause the wifi router in the boat 
to boot up. After about a minute, a WiFi network (typically with "Platypus" in the name) will appear to wireless devices. Connect the tablet and the phone to the boat's network. [wifi passwords?]
11. If you have a Lowrance unit, turn it on now and set up the options. Keep in mind that the Lowrance requires the boat to be powered at all times, or it will shut off.
12. Plug the phone into the arduino on the eboard with the USB cable. If the phone application is on the screen, the LED should blink green.
13. Press and briefly hold the big red button on the phone screen to start the application. The ESC's should beep and the LED should turn a solid green. The button on the phone should also turn green.
14. Verify that the phone server's boat type matches the type of boat you have. Swipe to the right on the phone to pull up some options. Scroll down until you see the boat type and make sure it is correct. If not, press on it and select the proper type. Swipe to the left to bring up the big button screen again.
15. Swipe to the left on the phone to pull up the manual motor control interface. This is just like the thumbstick control on the tablet, but may be more sensitive, so be gentle with it. Using the control, check that the motors turn the correct direction for forward, left, right, and reverse.
16. Swipe to the right to return to the screen with the big button. Note the IP address at the top. 
17. In the tablet application, press the connect button. In the window that pops up, enter the phone's IP address. Leave the other options with their default settings. If the tablet successfully connects to the phone, the red bar at the top of the tablet application will turn green.
18. Press the center button and zoom in until the boat's green arrow icon appears clearly.
19. Use the thumb stick to test the motor direction again, just like you did with the phone application.
20. Put the phone into the front compartment, pushing it onto the wall with velcro, keeping the USB cord to the starboard (right side when looking from the back of the boat to the front) side.
21. Turn the phone screen OFF.
22. Close the front plate and lock it down with the white tabs. Make sure that the USB cable is entirely inside the compartment and not stuck on the rim. If any of the tabs is very hard to turn, this may be a sign that the USB cable is wedged there. This MUST be done properly to protect the electronics from water!
23. Place the boat into the water, pushing it slightly away from the shore to avoid damaging the propellers.
24. Set the home location for the boat [directions]
25. TYPICAL TABLET USE DIRECTIONS, possibly link to another page. e.g. saving and loading waypoints, adjusting region transects, etc.
26. While you are using the boat, make sure the voltage doesn't go below X volts. A good rule of thumb is bringing the boat back once it reaches 15 volts while the boat isn't drawing current.
27. Once you are done or the battery needs to be changed, bring the boat back to the shore. Avoid damaging the propellers. Make sure you don't have any autonomy set up that you might accidentally reactivate by touching the tablet screen.
28. Open the front compartment. Make sure that any water that may have splashed over the top of the boat does not drip into the compartment or onto the inside of the plate near the eboard.
29. Press the white button on the eboard and unplug the battery.
30. Pull the phone out of the compartment. Turn the screen back on and press and hold the large button for 1 second. After you let go, the button should turn red again.
31. Close the front compartment again. Make sure both compartment plates are secure, as you are about to transport the boat again.
31. Kill the tablet application.
32. Pack up all your equipment and return.
33. Copy the files from the phone [directions]
34. Load the log file into Platypus online software.
35. If you had a Lowrance bathymetry unit, extract data from Lowrance and use Biobase.
36. Air out the compartments and remove pressure from the o-ring.
37. Remove the battery. If you plan to use the boat again in the near future, charge the battery.
38. Charge the tablet and phone. [Need them to connect either to internet to get usage info?]
