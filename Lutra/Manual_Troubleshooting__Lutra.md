## brainstorming list of issues:
* boat goes in circles (broken prop, caught shaft, stripped belt)
* boat heading oscillates back and forth (PID values, make sure decimal is there)
* tablet can't connect to boat (check both on same wifi network)
* battery is bloated (went too low on voltage, battery damaged)
* boat feels heavier after putting into and out of water (drain plug, fix leak)
* cooling water in back compartment (look for loose tubing)
* e-board stays blinking red (native port not programming port, change USB cable, broken e-board)
* sensor data looks strange, e.g. EC is always zero (sensors on wrong port, calibrate sensor, make sure water is getting to the sensor)
* don't see wifi network (bullet not plugged in or needs flashing)
* e-board color LED doesn't light up (are two small green LEDs on? if so, cycle the power to the board by pressing button twice, if they aren't on, check battery is plugged in)
* An airboat, teleop turns fan on and off, but fan won't turn (change server type to airboat)
* One or more of the motors spin in the wrong direction (switch any two of the banana connectors on the motor to reverse the spin   )
