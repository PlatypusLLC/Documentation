Documentation
=============

This is the main repository for general documentation for Platypus products.  From here there should be links to major other pieces of documentation, such as product specific manuals.

Configuration
-------------

This repository is set up to automatically build using ReadTheDocs.org, which pushes it through the [http://sphinx-do.org/](Sphinx Document Generator).  The generator converts reStructuredText (.rst) files into HTML, PDF, and EPUB documentation, which is then republished at [http://docs.senseplatypus.com](http://docs.senseplatypus.com).

Usage
-----

To edit documentation, simply create or modify .rst files in this repository and push the changes to GitHub.  When pushed, the documentation will automatically be rebuilt and served within ~10 minutes.  You can check the progress of this build on ReadTheDocs.org. **Remember, everything that is published to this repository is public.  Only commit public documentation to this repository!**
